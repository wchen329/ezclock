# ezClock
## A simple personal timesheet program

ezClock is a simple C# Windows Forms Timesheet keeping program. It's intended use is for personal text copies of a time sheet for the sake of convenience- it's not intended for industrial use cases. In fact, the usage of ezClock is more or less similar to that of a timesheet punch machine.
